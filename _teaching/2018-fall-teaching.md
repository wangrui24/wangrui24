### Course Descriptions
Macroeconomics is an economic course focusing on the study of the performance of macro economy. Its concerns include: What determines the rate of economic growth? What accounts for the high or low unemployment rate? Why does the economy sometimes become overheated and sometimes slip into recession? Why can some countries stabilize the commodity price and others can not do so, which results in the hyperinflation? Which role should government play in stimulating economic growth, curing inflation and lowering high unemployment rate, and which approaches can achieve the desired results? Why do some countries have favorable balance of the current account and others adverse balance of the current account? How can economic change of one country influence on that of others.
