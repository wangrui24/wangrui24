### Course Descriptions
"Special Topics on Chinese Economy" is a course aimed at building up capability of analyzing economic reality -- especially the reality of Chinese economy -- through economic theories. Classical macroeconomic and financial models will be introduced in the course, to help students to see through the real world problems, and to understand the economic insight behind the reality.
This is an application-oriented course. The ultimate goal of this course is to help students to get into the current debate about the Chinese economy, to get familiar with different arguments about heated topics such as rebalancing of the economic structure, growth of the shadow banking system, financial liberalization, etc.

This is also a course that emphasizes on economic theory. Classical economic models such as Neoclassical growth model, Monetary economic model, New Keynesian model, financial accelerator model, etc. will be introduced in an accessible way to undergraduate students. Intuitions of these economic models and their applications in the real world will be revealed in the course.
This is a course on the Chinese economy. Economic analyzing tools lectured in the course are selected on the basis of whether they deepen our understanding of China. The difference between the Chinese economy and mature market-based economies will be explained in the course. Students are expected to build up a general framework, in which different aspects of the Chinese economy can be analyzed in a consistent way.
